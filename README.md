Calendar Scheduler
# Description
This calender scheduler features an interactive layout that actively tells time of day and what day it is. The calender is color coded so that the user can tell whether the time they want to input has passed, is present, or is in the future. The website stores data in the local storage so that the user inputs stay even through refresh.
